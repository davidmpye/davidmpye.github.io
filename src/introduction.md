# Introduction

Welcome to my website!  I do a few things, personally and professionally.  This is my personal website, and mainly contains things relating to my hobbies and interests, which include:

* Electronics and embedded software (firmware) development, often in Rust these days
* Amateur radio (licenced radio amateur, M0DMP)
* IoT/Smart home things, using Homeassistant
* Electronics repair
* Member of [MakerSpace](https://www.makerspace.org.uk), a community Hackspace based in Newcastle/Gateshead

This website mainly contains:

* Some repair guides I've authored, giving useful info on repairing appliances etc (some of which the manufacturers don't want you to repair!)
* Archived PMR (Professional Mobile Radio) conversion information for now-obsolete radios (eg Storno/Tait/Dymar)

If you'd like to get hold of me, I use Gmail for personal emails, and my username is davidmpye.
