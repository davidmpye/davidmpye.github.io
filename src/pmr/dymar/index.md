## Information

Burndept Dymar
I don’t have very much info about these – they can be converted to 2m, but it’s quite a bit of work as they are originally AM sets.

Still, if you have some time, and can still manage to find any(!), then why not 😉

They have a rather clever cradle into which they sit, which will allow disconnection of power/antenna connections simply by pulling the radio out of it, making it nice and easy to remove!

In addition, they are already 100 channel, so once the modification is completed, there is no ‘panel bashing’ required to fit thumbswitches etc..
