# Storno 5000 Series

These guides relate to the Storno 5000 series - CQM5110 and CQM5660.

Most of these radios are long since in landfill (including the ones I'd played with years ago).  However, I've kept this archive information around for the last 20 years, so I might as well not delete it now....

The guides are accessible from the site index.
